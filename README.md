Program to the Snap! Card Game between two computer players. using 1 pack of
 cards (standard 52 card, 4 suit packs). The "Snap!" matching condition can be the face
 value of the card, the suit, or both.

Very simple RabbitMQ implementation using Reactive messaging principles. Communication 
 follows the actor model, with asynchronous message-passing. To run it open 5 consoles 
 and type:
 - python deck.py;
 - python pile.py;
 - python player.py player1;
 - python player.py player2; and
 - python mainSnapGame.py.

At the mainSnapGame console you will be asked how many decks you want to play with.

Dependencies:
 - RabbitMQ; and
 - pika.
